# Pin Code Application

## Overview

The Pin Code Application is a RESTful API built with Spring Boot, using H2 as an in-memory database and JPA for data management. This application provides endpoints to manage and retrieve pin code data for various regions. The API allows users to create, read, and update pin code records, making it a useful tool for applications that require pin code information.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Implements standard HTTP methods (GET, POST) for interacting with pin code data.
- **In-Memory Database**: Uses H2 database for fast data storage and retrieval.
- **JPA Integration**: Simplifies database operations with Spring Data JPA.
- **H2 Console**: Provides a web-based interface to view and manage the in-memory database.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/pincode`: Retrieve a list of all pin codes.
- `GET /api/pincode/{code}`: Retrieve a specific pin code record by code.
- `POST /api/pincode`: Create a new pin code record.
